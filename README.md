If the settings page has the rate selected as 40, means the 2 pics will change 40 times in a minute, if it is 20, it will change 20 times in a minute. The animation should change at a rate selected in the settings. It can say the rate should from 40 to 20 in 20 minutes, then that should happen.
11. A music selected in the settings page should play during those 20 minutes.
